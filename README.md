# webview-python

Python extension that provides API for the [webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) library.


## TODO

- [ ] Figure out why `examples/with_server.py` doesn't work
- [ ] Better function binding support (automate `json.dumps` and `json.loads`)
- [ ] Remove support for Python 2.x
